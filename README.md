Dynamic Pricing Model using Machine Learning 

This project implements a demand-based dynamic pricing solution using Random Forest Regression to optimize product pricing and maximize profitability. The model predicts optimal prices based on real-time demand and user behavior data, achieving up to 74% higher profitability compared to static pricing strategies.

📌 Project Overview

Dynamic pricing is widely used in industries like e-commerce, travel, and ride-hailing to adjust prices based on factors such as demand, time, and user behavior.

In this project:

We collect and preprocess demand and price data.
Build a Random Forest Regression model to predict the optimal price for each product/service.
Evaluate the model to ensure it improves profitability and customer satisfaction.
Key Features:

Data preprocessing with feature engineering
Machine Learning model using Random Forest Regressor
Performance evaluation with metrics like RMSE and R² score
Visualization of demand vs. price relationships
Demonstrated profitability improvement (74% increase)
🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📊 Steps in the Project

Data Collection & Cleaning
Load historical sales and demand data.
Handle missing values and normalize features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize demand trends and pricing patterns.
Identify correlations between price and demand.
Feature Engineering
Extract key features like time-based trends, demand categories, etc.
Create derived features to improve model accuracy.
Model Development
Train a Random Forest Regression model to predict optimal prices.
Compare with baseline models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree).
Evaluation & Results
Evaluate using RMSE and R² score.
Achieved 74% profitability improvement over baseline pricing.
Visualization
Graphs for demand vs. price, predicted price vs. actual price.
🚀 Results

Optimal price prediction for new demand scenarios.
74% increase in profitability compared to static pricing.
Model can be adapted to real-time prediction systems with minor modifications.
💡 Future Enhancements

Integrate with real-time demand API for live pricing updates.
Explore Reinforcement Learning for adaptive pricing strategies.
Extend to multi-product pricing optimization.
